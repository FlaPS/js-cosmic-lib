To be done before beta.1 release (hopefully end-april)
* Support custom aliases for addresses
* Makes format error detection more precise
* Properly handle datas setters
* Allow default configuration & customization of it
* Implement cosmic link builder
* Have a native english-speaker check all the messages
* Write a demo.html
* Handle memo conflict even when not computing transaction
* In a broader sense the error handling is spread between
	- query2tdesc, format.tdesc, json2transaction & cosmicLink.sign()
	Let's see what I can do to clean this up a bit
* Extensive tests on various browsers/versions/OS
* Allow additionnal transaction fields: sequence, network


To be done before 1.0 release (hopefully end-june)
* Better onParse / onClick event handling
* Be sure reverse addresses resolution works properly
* More secure federated addresses resolution
* Handle multi-operation transactions
* Multi-signature collection service
* Gather legit signers for a transaction
* Allow signatures in URLs
* Handle ledger nano S
* Support private networks
* Internationalization support
* First translations
* Several external projects using CosmicLib
* Extensive testing
